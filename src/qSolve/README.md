# qSolve
Takes two double arrays of size three, the input array and the array of roots.
Also takes an integer 'log' to know if logging is enabled and takes a file pointer in case it is.

qSolve first determines the number of roots that will be calculated for the input values, then it will calculate the roots and store them in the roots[] array

There are no return values, but the data stored in the roots array is available in main().
